### Project Description

This notebook is the first of 3 published for my [MSDS Capstone Project](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php){target="_blank"} at Northwestern University.   
The objective of this project is to demonstrate core MSDS programming and data analysis skills. 
   
These notebooks support analysis published in the [Summary: Model Development Guide (PDF)](https://github.com/talentrics/MSDS_Capstone_Project/blob/master/Credit_Problem_4_Model_Development_Guide.pdf){target="_blank"}
   
**Below is a summary of the notebooks published in relation to this project:**  
   
* [EDA & Data Transformation](https://github.com/talentrics/MSDS_Capstone_Project/blob/master/Credit_Problem_1_EDA.md){target="_blank"} **(This Notebook)**     
* [Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Analysis](https://github.com/talentrics/MSDS_Capstone_Project/blob/master/Credit_Problem_2_Tree_Models.md){target="_blank"}  
* [Regression and Principal Components Analysis](https://github.com/talentrics/MSDS_Capstone_Project/blob/master/Credit_Problem_3_Regression_Models.md){target="_blank"}  
    
### Data Overview

* Source: [‘Default of Credit Card Clients Data Set’](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients){target="_blank"} on UCI Machine Learning Repository.   
* The data were provided by a bank in Taiwan in 2016 for purposes of 'default' prediction.
* The data are 30,000 individual customer observations with 30 attributes.
* Observations were over a six month period from April to September of 2005.
* Attributes = available credit, gender, age, marital status, & bill payment. 
* Response variable = 'DEFAULT' - did the customer default (1 = True).   
   
This notebook summarizes Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Tranformation.   
Model development and testing of predictions in notebooks linked above.

### Part 1 Data Overview


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
