### Project Description

This notebook is the first of 3 published for my [MSDS Capstone Project](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php){target="_blank"} at Northwestern University.   
Source data: [‘Default of Credit Card Clients Data Set’](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients){target="_blank"} posted on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Part 1 Data Overview


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
